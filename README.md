# NebulaX Video NFT DEX

## Brief Overview of NebulaX


**NebulaX** is a groundbreaking decentralized video DEX NFT platform designed to empower emerging creators worldwide. Our vision is to provide a secure, transparent, and engaging marketplace where creators can upload, mint, and trade their video and image contentâ€”free from centralized gatekeeping and unreliable monetization systems.

---

## What It Does

**For Creators (Sellers):**  
- **Connect Wallet:** Seamless wallet integration allows creators to securely access the platform.  
- **Content Upload & Minting** Creators can upload their video and image content and mint it as an NFT using ERC721/1155 standards (currently, a smart contract issue causes videos to be minted as images).  
- **Set Product Details:** Assign unique token IDs, add descriptions, and set pricing for each NFT.

**For Buyers:**  
- **Secure Purchase:** Buyers can connect their wallets, browse the marketplace, and purchase NFTs with confidence.  
- **Engagement through Gamification:**  
  - **Daily Spinning Wheel:** Users can spin once a day to win bonus NebX tokens (our in-app currency), although currently, the spinning wheel only displays the UI without awarding tokens.  
  - **Raffle Draw:** A feature intended to foster a competitive community spirit by allowing users to create and participate in raffles; at the moment, it displays as a static table, pending full logic implementation for automated raffle creation, ticketing, and winner selection.

---

## How It Was Made & Tools Used

- **User Interface & Design:**  
  - Figma for initial design prototypes.  
  - Tailwind CSS and React for a responsive, mobile-friendly front-end.
  
- **Smart Contract Development:**  
  - Developed using Remix for initial testing, Hardhat for deployment, and the OpenZeppelin library for secure contract standards.  
  - Deployed on the Arbitrum Sepolia network.
  
- **API & Backend:**  
  - Vottun API was chosen for its frictionless, borderless integration, ensuring a smooth backend experience.
  
- **Additional Tools:**  
  - Gelato for scheduled tasks and automation and ABC Testing for blockchain testing.

---

## Challenges & Current Status

**Whatâ€™s Working:**  
- **Wallet Connectivity & NFT Minting:** Users can successfully connect wallets, upload content, and mint NFTs (with the current limitation of videos being processed as images).  
- **Marketplace Transactions:** Buyers can reliably purchase NFTs.  
- **Basic Gamified UI:** The spinning wheel and raffle table are integrated into the UI.

**Whatâ€™s Not Working:**  
- **Video Minting Issue:** Our smart contract currently mints video content as images due to an unresolved bug.  
- **Spinning Wheel Rewards:** While the spinning wheel interface functions, it does not yet display the awarded NebX tokens.  
- **Raffle Draw Functionality:** The raffle draw is only a static table at the moment; full automation for raffle creation, ticket sales, and winner selection is pending further development.

---

## Future Roadmap

- **Short-Term Improvements:**  
  - Fix the smart contract to mint video content as video NFTs properly.  
  - Integrate NebX token display and reward allocation within the spinning wheel.  
  - Enhance the raffle draw feature with complete logic for dynamic raffle creation and automated winner selection.

- **Long-Term Vision (Launch by 2027):**  
  - Launch a mobile-responsive website and a dedicated mobile app for iOS and Android.  
  - Release a beta version next year for early feedback.  
  - Target 5 million creators globally through strategic partnerships and robust community engagement.
  - Empower content creators worldwide with a reliable, innovative monetization platform.
