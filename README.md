# NebulaX

**NebulaX** is a groundbreaking decentralized video DEX NFT platform designed to empower creators worldwide. Our vision is to provide a secure, transparent, and engaging marketplace where creators can upload, mint, and trade their video and image contentâ€”free from centralized gatekeeping and unreliable monetization systems.

## What It Does

**For Creators (Sellers):**  
- **Connect Wallet:** Seamless wallet integration allows creators to securely access the platform.  
- **Content Upload & Minting:** Creators can upload their video and image content and mint it as an NFT using ERC721/1155 standards. (Note: Due to a smart contract bug, videos are currently minted as images.)  
- **Set Product Details:** Assign unique token IDs, add descriptions, and set pricing for each NFT.

**For Buyers:**  
- **Secure Purchase:** Buyers can connect their wallets, browse the marketplace, and purchase NFTs with confidence.  
- **Engagement through Gamification:**  
  - **Daily Spinning Wheel:** Users can spin once a day to win bonus NebX tokens (our in-app currency). Currently, the spinning wheel UI displays correctly but does not yet award tokens.  
  - **Raffle Draw:** Intended to foster community spirit by allowing users to create raffles for NFTs with set start/end dates and ticket sales; presently, it appears as a static table awaiting full logic integration.

  - Deployed on the **ABC Testnet**.

## Challenges & Current Status

**Whatâ€™s Working:**  
- **Wallet Connectivity & NFT Minting:** Users can successfully connect wallets, upload content, and mint NFTs (with the current limitation of video content being processed as images).  
- **Marketplace Transactions:** Buyers can reliably purchase NFTs.  
- **Basic Gamified UI:** The spinning wheel and raffle table are integrated into the UI.

**Whatâ€™s Not Working:**  
- **Video Minting Issue:** Our smart contract currently mints videos as images due to a bug that needs to be resolved.  
- **Spinning Wheel Rewards:** The spinning wheel interface functions, but it does not yet display or award NebX tokens.  
- **Raffle Draw Functionality:** The raffle draw is only a static table; the complete logic for automated raffle creation, ticket sales, and winner selection is still in development.

## Future Roadmap & Strategy

**Short-Term Improvements:**  
- Fix the smart contract to correctly mint video content as video NFTs.  
- Integrate the NebX token display and reward mechanism within the spinning wheel.  
- Enhance the raffle draw feature to support dynamic creation, ticket purchases, and automated winner selection.

**Long-Term Vision (Launch by 2027):**  
- Launch a mobile-responsive website and a dedicated mobile app for iOS and Android.  
- Release a beta version next year for early user feedback.  
- Target onboarding 5 million creators globally through strategic partnerships and a robust community ecosystem.  
- Empower content creators worldwide with innovative monetization and engagement tools.
